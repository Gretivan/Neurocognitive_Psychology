A repository for the Neurocognitive Psychology project conducted as part of the MSc05 module of the [Psychology Master program](https://www.psychologie.uni-frankfurt.de/48331594/Willkommen_auf_den_Seiten_des_Instituts_f%C3%BCr_Psychologie?legacy_request=1) of the [Goethe-University Frankfurt](https://www.uni-frankfurt.de/de?), specifically the cognition major/concentration and [neurocognitive psychology lab](http://www.fiebachlab.org/).

## Overview

This is a Neurocognitive Psychology repository containing the relevant code, an openlaab notebook as well as further information related to potential cortical thickness differences found in males and females with and without Autism Spektrum disorder. To analyse differences in cortical thickness and between sexes, the [Abide I](http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/abide_I.html) opensource dataset will be utilised. The respective papers can also be found on [OSF](https://osf.io/fnwd5/). 

The goal of this project is to assess whether cortical thickness differences exist between individuals with and without autism. Whether there is a differentiation in grey matter volume between male autism and female autism, as well as between male controls and female controls exists will also be assessed using machine learning. This information could subsequently be used as a potential method to diagnose autism. 

### Structure and content

Information regarding the code and the data used can be found in this repository, in addition to an openlab notebook where data exploration and analysis is presented. 

### Acknowledgements

I would like to express my deepest appreciation to Peer Herholz for his effort in creating this module for us and for providing so much new and valuable information and skill for us to learn, and for always being kind and helpful when it was needed no matter how big or small. A big thanks to Michael Ernst for giving so much informational input and providing in person sessions for useful exchanges, and to Maren Wehrheim for supervising and assisitng with the data analysis, and for providing new and innovative ways of applying machine learning methods.
