A template repository for projects conducted as part of the MSc05 module of the [Psychology Master program](https://www.psychologie.uni-frankfurt.de/48331594/Willkommen_auf_den_Seiten_des_Instituts_f%C3%BCr_Psychologie?legacy_request=1) of the [Goethe-University Frankfurt](https://www.uni-frankfurt.de/de?), specifically the cognition major/concentration and [neurocognitive psychology lab](http://www.fiebachlab.org/).

## Overview

This is a Neurocognitive Psychology repository containing the relevant code, an openlaab notebook as well as further information related to potential cortical thickness differences found in males and females with and without Autism Spektrum disorder. To analyse differences in cortical thickness and between sexes, the [Abide I](http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/abide_I.html) opensource dataset will be utilised. The respective papers can also be found on [OSF](https://osf.io/fnwd5/). 

The goal of this project is to assess whether cortical thickness differences exist between individuals with and without autism. Whether there is a differentiation in grey matter volume between male autism and female autism, as well as between male controls and female controls exists will also be assessed using machine learning. This information could subsequently be used as a potential method to diagnose autism. 

### Structure and content
