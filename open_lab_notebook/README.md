This week I will reorganise and annotate my githup repository to make it more visible. I also looked for an atlas that will be used to determine regions of interest. I used a paper to determine a good atlas to use based on past research papers into cortical thickness differences in individuals with and without Autism.

This week I aim to assess the demographic information of my data set - including the number of male and female participants, the average age, and the number of autistic vs. control participants. In addition to this I have loaded my atlas in jupyter and loaded the labels for the 150 areas of the Destrieux Atlas.

 This week I loaded my Atlas and established what the 150 labels are for the areas of the Atlas. I looked at some demographic data - including how many females and males there are in the sample, and how many of the participants were controls and how many were participants with Autism. I read through course content to get an idea of what the next steps will be. 

 Next Steps:
 - establish which brain images to download - aka all the female ppts and some of the male ppts
 - download images, potentially with labels like male-autism, male-control etc. 
 - demographics for the dataset downloaded

 -  for preprocessing - merge atlas with the cortical thickness data you have - converting mean area of cortical map on atlas
 --- Masked Data - nilearn documentation masker 
 - for all peopel use a small loop 

 - for participants, match the participants - males to females in order to not make it random
 aka match age, handedness maybe?, comorbidities, brain trauma, medication, 
 - manually delete checkpoints, and change git ignore

 - tip: when putting data in to the model ASSURE that its the same reihenfolge as in your dataframe
