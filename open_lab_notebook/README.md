This week I will reorganise and annotate my githup repository to make it more visible. I also looked for an atlas that will be used to determine regions of interest. I used a paper to determine a good atlas to use based on past research papers into cortical thickness differences in individuals with and without Autism.

This week I aim to assess the demographic information of my data set - including the number of male and female participants, the average age, and the number of autistic vs. control participants. In addition to this I have loaded my atlas in jupyter and loaded the labels for the 150 areas of the Destrieux Atlas.
